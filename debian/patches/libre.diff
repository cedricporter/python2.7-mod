 Starting with Python 2.3, simple uses of the \regexp{*?} pattern are
 special-cased to avoid recursion.  Thus, the above regular expression
 can avoid recursion by being recast as
-\regexp{Begin [a-zA-Z0-9_ ]*?end}.  As a further benefit, such regular
+`Begin [a-zA-Z0-9_ ]*?end'.  As a further benefit, such regular
 expressions will run faster than their recursive equivalents.
